# Piano Trainer - Refactoring Guide

This document outlines the refactoring changes made to the Piano Trainer application to improve its architecture and maintainability.

## New Architecture

The codebase has been reorganized with a more decoupled, service-oriented architecture:

### Core Directory Structure

```
src/core/
├── models/      # Type definitions and constants
├── services/    # Business logic services
├── hooks/       # React hooks for reusable functionality
├── contexts/    # React context definitions
└── providers/   # Context provider components
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Separation of Concerns**

   - Moved business logic from components into dedicated services
   - Created reusable hooks for common functionality

2. **Improved Type System**

   - Centralized type definitions in `models/types.ts`
   - Consistent type usage throughout the application

3. **Decoupled State Management**

   - Created clear context interfaces in `contexts/`
   - Simplified provider implementations

4. **Service-Oriented Architecture**
   - `scaleService.ts` - Scale generation and manipulation
   - `chordService.ts` - Chord calculation and validation
   - `noteService.ts` - Note conversion utilities
   - `midiService.ts` - MIDI device communication

## Migration Guide

To complete the migration to the new architecture, you'll need to:

1. Update imports in existing components to reference the new core modules
2. Replace the existing providers with the refactored versions
3. Test each module to ensure functionality is preserved

## Testing Strategy

1. First test the core services in isolation
2. Then test the hooks with mock data
3. Finally test the full application with all components integrated

## Next Steps

1. Complete the migration of remaining components
2. Add unit tests for the core services
3. Implement a more robust scale generation system
4. Improve the error handling throughout the application
